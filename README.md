# preview-image-folder

Start server by

```
npm run dev
```

 and open http://localhost:3000 or other browser-sync outputs.

Then, you can add images into public/images and the browser should be auto-reloaded and show images in the directory.

You can change directory or image extensions at `start.sh`
